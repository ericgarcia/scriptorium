# Setting up your own desk

Scriptorium is the framework. Your writing lives in a *separate private repo*
that mounts scriptorium as a submodule. The fastest path is the scaffolding tool;
the manual steps are below it so you can see what it does.

## The one-liner

```bash
# from anywhere; point it at where you want your desk
path/to/scriptorium/tools/new-desk ~/code/writing-desk
```

By default the new desk mounts scriptorium from its public URL. To develop
against a **local** scriptorium checkout (before it's pushed anywhere), pass it:

```bash
tools/new-desk ~/code/writing-desk --framework /Users/you/code/scriptorium
```

Then create the private GitHub repo when you're ready:

```bash
cd ~/code/writing-desk
gh repo create <you>/writing-desk --private --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin main
```

## What it sets up (the manual version)

### 1. The instance repo

```bash
mkdir writing-desk && cd writing-desk
git init
```

### 2. Scriptorium as a submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/<you>/scriptorium.git framework
git commit -m "Add scriptorium framework submodule"
```

### 3. Wire the shared skills in

Claude Code discovers skills from `.claude/skills/`. Symlink the framework's
skills so they stay a single source of truth:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
for s in draft critique tune-style whats-on-the-desk; do
  ln -s "../../framework/skills/$s" ".claude/skills/$s"
done
```

Private skills tuned to you live as **real files** under `.claude/skills/`, not
in the framework.

### 4. Bring in a style to tune

Copy a starter style out of the framework into your instance, where you'll tune
it privately:

```bash
mkdir -p styles
cp -R framework/styles/plain-english styles/my-voice
```

Your trained styles live in the instance and never go back into the framework.

### 5. Behavior file and dashboard

```bash
cp framework/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md   # then adjust to taste
```

Create a top-level `DASHBOARD.md` with one block per piece, and start your first
piece:

```bash
mkdir -p pieces/<name>
cp -R framework/templates/piece/. pieces/<name>/
```

### 6. Publishing — connect a real browser

Only needed when you want to publish. **Substack has no public write API**, so `publish` and
`substack-sync` work by driving the editor in a real browser, and the default compose transport
pastes from the system clipboard so that no part of your prose is ever retyped by the agent. See
**Requirements** in the [README](../README.md) for why that matters.

```bash
# 1. install the extension (Chrome Web Store), sign in, then:
claude --chrome

# 2. confirm the connection
/chrome     # want: "Status: Enabled" and "Extension: Installed"
```

You need the **Claude in Chrome extension v1.0.36+**, a **direct Anthropic plan** (Pro, Max, Team
or Enterprise), and a Claude Code session signed in with **`/login`** — an API-key or
`setup-token` session cannot use the extension. `/chrome` → **Enabled by default** removes the
flag, at the cost of loading browser tools every session.

Then record your publication's specifics in the instance (never in the framework):

```bash
mkdir -p publishing
$EDITOR publishing/substack.md   # byline, subdomain, publication name, bio
```

Each piece additionally needs a `publish.yaml` — `title`, `subtitle`, `footnotes`
(native|endnotes|none), `send_email` (default false), and, once it is live, both `post_url` (the
**editor** address, `/publish/post/<id>`) and `public_url` (the **reader** address, `/p/<slug>`).
Those are two different URLs and both are needed: the editor one drives re-syncs, and the reader
one is the only URL that may appear in another essay's body.

**Not on macOS?** `tools/md_to_clipboard.py` uses the AppleScript pasteboard, so the clipboard
transport is **macOS-only today** — that is the one platform-specific piece of the framework, and
it is the only path that has ever been run. Use the JS-snippet fallback the `publish` skill
documents, knowing it reintroduces the transcription risk the clipboard exists to remove, and
verify the composed post against the draft either way.

**Porting it is a small, well-scoped contribution and it is wanted** — one function,
`set_clipboard_html()`. See *Platform support* in the [README](../README.md) for the sketches and
for the one requirement that matters: the payload has to land under the HTML clipboard **flavor**.
Plain text is the trap — it pastes, it looks like it worked, and every heading, blockquote, italic
and link is silently gone.

## Keeping the framework up to date

```bash
git submodule update --remote framework
git commit -am "Update scriptorium framework"
```

## Cloning your desk elsewhere

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <your instance repo>
# or, after a plain clone:
git submodule update --init
```
