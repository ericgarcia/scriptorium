"""check_pronouns.py — the pronoun sweeps this desk kept doing by hand, as one tool.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-03).  Three pronoun rules live in the constitutions and all three
were being enforced by ad-hoc greps typed fresh in each session — and a rule no sweep checks
is a rule nobody enforces.  *The Mask Comes Off Last* reached a composed Substack draft
carrying twenty-one generic masculines for the villain (the 2026-09-01 rule said they/them),
and then a lowercase *the one* for God (the essay voice capitalizes God named indirectly:
*the One*, *Someone*).  Both were caught by Eric, after compose, reading the page.

WHY E AND F EXIST (2026-09-07).  The first four sections stop at a quotation's edge — inside
one, the source's case was taken as evidence and left alone.  But the constitution's casing and
bracket rules reach INSIDE this house's own scripture (see `God_in_quotations`,
`God_in_quotations_casing`, `God_in_quotations_exclusions` in the essay voice's config.yaml), and
nothing was sweeping there.  *False Light*, 2026-09-07, measured four misses in one draft, all
inside italic King James quotations: Matthew 4:10 *Him only shalt thou serve* (a capital
*Him* that refers to the Father — the house pronoun is *[Them]*, bracketed, since that is a
substitution); Matthew 5:45 *He maketh His sun* (same: Father, so *[They make] [Their] sun*);
John 5:30 *of mine own self* and John 15:5 *without me* (the Son speaking, whose own pronouns
the house capitalizes inside a quotation — *Me*, *My*, *Mine* — as a casing convention, never
bracketed).  Eric caught the first one reading the page; the rest fell out of the audit it
prompted.  A sweep that stops at the quotation's edge cannot see any of them.

WHY H EXISTS (2026-09-10).  Section D catches a bare lowercase *it* / *its* within six words
after a God-word, and that shape is only half of how God gets turned into a *what*.  The other
half is the REFLEXIVE, which D's window never sees: *They Them* shipped live carrying *the source
that called itself us before it had made anything at all* and *A plural form, speaking of itself
in the plural* — both corrected to *Themself* — and again it was Eric, reading the published page,
who caught them.  A window cannot find these: the antecedent is what matters, and the two
legitimate uses in the corpus (*a second thing standing outside God on its own ground*, *the
clutching self is the source of its own suffering*) sit just as close to a God-word as the misses
do.  So H asks a grammatical question instead of a proximity one — whose reflexive is it? — and
its two paths are the two ways this corpus's answer comes out *God*.

WHAT IT CHECKS, on the whole draft body (footnotes included), whitespace-normalized:

  A. A SENTENCE-INITIAL CAPITAL THAT READS AS DEITY  He/Him/His/They/Them/She/Her at the head of a
     sentence, WHERE THE NEAREST ANTECEDENT IS A PERSON.  English forces the capital on every
     pronoun at a sentence head, so the capital itself is not the fault; in a house that
     capitalizes deity pronouns, the one that does damage is a HUMAN's, which then reads as the
     Son, the Father or the Spirit.  A capital whose nearest antecedent is God is correct and
     unremarkable, and so is one in a paragraph that has just named the person — the reader knows
     who is meant.  The capital can only be MISREAD where God is in play in the same paragraph, so
     both a figure and a God-word must be present, the figure nearer.  Listing every capital buried
     the real ones 485-deep, and listing every human-antecedent one still put 51 correct sentences
     up for review (narrowed twice on 2026-09-10, Eric's call).  Fix it by recasting the sentence
     so the pronoun is not its first word, or by using the name.
     KNOWN LIMIT: `nearest antecedent` mis-attributes where a person's NAME sits beside a divine
     pronoun — a scripture citation (*John 10*), or an author quoted about God.  *None but He and
     I* reads its *He* as Brother Lawrence when the word is God's, in Lawrence's own phrase.
  B. GENERIC MASCULINE  he/him/his/himself, and *a man*, *any man*, *one man*, *the man*.
     An imagined person is they/them; a real one — from scripture, history or a story, or the
     author — keeps their own pronouns.  A person named in `figures:` in the
     piece's publish.yaml — or passed with --names — is STICKY FOR THE REST OF ITS PARAGRAPH, and
     hits after them are theirs.  The old test was a 120-character lookback, far shorter than this
     desk's prose: *Rising After Falls* names Brother Lawrence once and then says *he* for two
     hundred words, and 85 of its 98 hits read GENERIC? when every one was Lawrence.
  C. GOD AS A LOWERCASE OBLIQUE, OR AS A *WHAT*  lowercase *someone / whoever / the one /
     a mind / one mind / something* where the same sentence names God (God, Lord, Father,
     Spirit, Them, infinite, dream(ing), remembering, the One).  The house capitalizes
     these when they mean God, and never refers to God as a thing.
  D. LOWERCASE DEITY PRONOUN  he/him/his/it within six words after God / the Lord / the Father /
     the Spirit / Christ / Jesus, outside a verbatim quotation.  Inside a quotation the source's
     own case is evidence and stays (the KJV lowercases; the house capitalizes in its own prose
     and, for its own scripture, raises the case — see the constitution).
  E. CAPITALIZED He/Him/His/Himself INSIDE A SCRIPTURE QUOTATION.  A capital there is the house
     saying *this is the Son*.  If the referent is the Father, the word is wrong, not the case:
     God-as-God is *They/Them*, and inside a verbatim quotation that is a substitution, so it is
     bracketed — *[Them] only shalt thou serve* — with the verb bracketed too where agreement
     needs it (*[They make]*, never *[They] maketh*).  The tool cannot know the referent; it
     lists every hit with its sentence, and each is justified as the Son or repaired.
  F. LOWERCASE me/my/mine/myself INSIDE A GOSPEL QUOTATION.  Where the speaker is the Son the
     house capitalizes His own pronouns in the quotation — *He that hath seen Me hath seen the
     Father* — as a casing convention (never bracketed, disclosed once per piece).  Heuristic:
     the quotation is followed by a footnote ref whose definition cites a Gospel (Matthew, Mark,
     Luke, John — not 1/2/3 John) and it contains a first-person pronoun.  A Gospel voice is not
     always Jesus (the prodigal's *make me as one of thy hired servants*), so it lists, and the
     operator names the speaker.
  H. LOWERCASE REFLEXIVE FOR GOD  *itself* / *its own* / *themself* whose antecedent is God.
     Two paths, each reported with the evidence that qualified it:
       `subject` / `rel` / `appositive` — the subject of the reflexive's own clause resolves to a
         God-word.  A relative clause takes the head noun it attaches to (*the source that called
         itself*), and a head noun that is an appositive in a copular chain resolves through it
         (*They are the One …, the verb …, the source that called itself*).  A possessive
         (*God's power … on its own*) is NOT the subject; *power* is.
       `self-naming` — the reflexive is the object of a verb of self-reference (call, name,
         describe, reveal, speak of, refer to, show, declare) in a paragraph that names God.  Only
         a someone can be *called* something, so in a God paragraph the referent is God.
     The INTENSIVE *itself* is skipped — *the thing itself*, *the wall itself* — where the word
     emphasizes a noun rather than standing for it; a God-word taking it (*the Father itself*) is
     kept.  Like C and G, a justified hit is silenced by a substring under `pronouns_allow:`.
     H warns, it never refuses: the antecedent is a human call, and the tool is guessing at one.

  WHAT COUNTS AS A SCRIPTURE QUOTATION, for E and F: an italic span `*…*` that is followed by a
  footnote ref whose definition cites the KJV or a book of the Bible, or a blockquote (`> …`)
  carrying such a ref.  For E only, an italic span or blockquote with no ref but King James
  diction (thou / thee / thy / ye / hath / shalt / -eth …) also counts — the Matthew 4:10 miss
  was exactly a span whose ref sat on a different span two sentences earlier.  Each hit says
  which evidence qualified it (`ref:matt4` or `kjv-diction`).  Footnote DEFINITIONS are never
  swept by E or F: a footnote carries the source's own wording unchanged, and that is the
  disclosure.  The three exclusions in the constitution (another organization's fixed text; a
  text quoted as evidence about its translators; any non-Judeo-Christian scripture) are
  judgments the tool cannot make — a hit inside one of those is justified by naming the
  exclusion, exactly as a section-B hit is justified by naming the person.

It REPORTS; it does not edit, and it cannot know a referent.  The operator justifies every hit
by naming who it points at — that is the sweep, and this tool only makes sure it happens.

USAGE
    python3 check_pronouns.py <piece-dir> [--names A,B,C] [--strict]
      --names   comma-separated named figures whose pronouns are theirs (Campbell,Peter,...)
      --strict  exit 3 if any C or D hit remains (for a publish preflight); A, B, E, F, G and H
                always exit 0 because they are lists to be justified, not verdicts — E, F, G and
                H each need a human call on a referent or a speaker, which no rule can make.
    G lists every *Lord* (mixed case) outside a footnote definition — the house sets *the LORD*
    in capitals wherever the word names God (2026-09-07), own prose and quoted scripture alike,
    so each remaining *Lord* is justified by naming what it is instead: the lord in a parable, an emperor called lord, the Lord of another faith, an invented deity, an
    institution's fixed wording, or a title such as the Lord's Prayer. A justified G-hit is silenced the same way as a C-hit, by a substring under
    `pronouns_allow:` in publish.yaml. Footnote definitions are never swept: the note that records
    the King James's wording keeps the King James's own *Lord*.
    A hit in C, D, E, F, G or H whose referent has been named is justified by listing a substring
    of it in the piece's publish.yaml under `pronouns_allow:` — reviewable, and it survives the
    session.  E and F joined the list on 2026-09-10, for the reason D did: a section that refuses
    or warns for ever, with no way to record the ruling, makes every later session re-derive the
    same referent.  Not every E-hit is even a deity pronoun — *He that hath seen Me hath seen the
    Father* is the King James's own sentence-initial capital on *he that* = *whoever*.
    D honors the list for the same reason C does (2026-09-10): D is a PROXIMITY test, so most of
    what it finds is a pronoun for something else standing near a God-word — *God is black, and
    meant it ontologically* (the claim), *the sentence says it takes both* (an expletive). Both
    sections refuse under --strict, so both need a way to say *this referent has been named*;
    without one the only way to clear a D-hit is to reword the draft, which on a published piece
    means editing live prose to satisfy a linter.
