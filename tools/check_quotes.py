"""check_quotes.py — check a draft's NON-SCRIPTURE quotations against the sources held on disk.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  `check_scripture.py` closed this hole for one source: every scripture quotation is
  matched against a local KJV index, and the house conventions are understood rather
  than reported as errors. Everything else in a piece — a book, an opinion, a lexicon,
  a transcript — was still checked by a human or a model opening the file, or not at all.

  `check_verified.py` is honest that it only records whether somebody SAID they checked.
  This is the other half: for a source the desk actually holds, whether the words in the
  draft are the words in the source.

  (Eric, 2026-09-11: *"make sure that scriptorium is checking references against resources
  that we have locally and not from the LLM itself."* The tool that answers the second half
  of that sentence is `references.py`, which brings a source in and indexes it.)

THE OUTCOME THAT MATTERS MOST IS **NOT HELD**.
  A quotation whose source is not in `books/<book>/references/` was checked by nothing.
  That is the state in which a model supplies wording from memory, and today it is
  invisible — a piece with twelve unheld quotations looks exactly like a piece with none.
  So it is a finding, printed as loudly as drift, and it exits non-zero.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, SAID BEFORE THE GREEN CHECK IS BELIEVED.
  It compares words to words. It cannot tell you the page says what the prose claims it
  says, that the source is any good, or that a paraphrase is fair. A MATCH means the
  quotation is real; it does not mean the argument built on it is. That read is `review`'s,
  and it is a human's.

    an alias for FIVE held sources (two lexicons, a Syriac study, the Summa, Notovitch),
    "thing" for Novak's story collection, "nicene" for the Ante-Nicene Fathers. A
    footnote about the Nicene Creed therefore "named" eight sources, and its quotation
    was then reported as drift against whichever of them happened to share four common
    words. (Measured 2026-09-11 on son-of-joseph, by the session that ran this tool

    surname, taken from the author position rather than from anywhere in the cell. The

    The weight matters as much as the match. When a quotation is in NONE of the sources
