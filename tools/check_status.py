"""check_status.py — does the desk's PROSE still agree with its manifests?

Three tools already guard three other things, and a sentence can be wrong while all
three pass:

  check_links.py   a URL resolves.
  check_refs.py    a cross-reference names the right piece (titles move).
  outlet_audit.py  a piece exists on every outlet it declares (half-published).

None of them reads what the prose CLAIMS. This does.

WHY (2026-09-09, four times in one week)

  * *In Vain* — the founding-writings index and the charter both called it "composed as
    a private draft; unpublished". It had gone live that morning.
  * *The Mask Comes Off Last* — "unpublished", and carrying no link, five days after it
    published. The index was breaking its own stated rule, that live pieces link to
    their reader URL.
  * *Rising After Falls* — published by another session mid-afternoon; the index still
    called it unpublished an hour later. Found by the first run of this tool.
  * The charter still called the Fellowship's domain "open, and Eric's call" after the
    site had shipped. See the limits below: this one is not mechanically visible.

Every case has the same shape. `publish.yaml` is written by the sync tools against the
live post; the prose is written by hand. **The manifest is the witness**, and prose that
contradicts it is what this reports.

WHAT IT CHECKS

  unpublished  prose calls a piece unpublished; its manifest carries a reader URL.
  phantom      prose links a piece as live; its manifest carries no reader URL at all.
  unlinked     a live piece is named with no link, against the house rule — reported
               only in files that STATE that rule, so it never fires on a document that
               never made the promise.
  address      with --prefer OUTLET, a piece linked at another outlet's URL when the
               preferred outlet has one. Use it after moving a publication's home.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED, on check_refs.py's principle that a checker which
cries about correct files gets switched off:

  * `DASHBOARD.md`. It is generated from `DASHBOARD.d`; the fragments are checked instead,
    so a finding names the file you would actually edit.
  * `log/`, `corrections.md`, and everything under a dated heading. They are append-only
    records of what was true when written. An entry saying "unpublished" is accurate
    history, and "fixing" it would be editing the evidence.
  * Any line that marks its own supersession — retired, superseded, (was …), formerly,
    replaced. Naming an old state in order to retire it is the correct use of one.
  * Whether a DECISION has gone stale. The charter case above is real drift and this
    cannot see it: no file records that a decision was made, so there is nothing to
    disagree with. Only a person re-reading catches that, and it is worth saying plainly
    rather than implying the sweep is complete.

CONFIG (instance-side; the framework holds no URLs)

  --outlets publishing/outlets.yaml — the same registry outlet_audit.py reads. A piece
  is PUBLISHED if any outlet's `manifest_url_key` is set in its manifest, or if it still
  opts in the pre-outlets way with `site: true` and the registry names a legacy_outlet.

  A LIMIT OF `address`, worth knowing before trusting a clean run: it can only compare
  what the manifest records. A piece opting in the legacy way carries no outlet URL, so
  there is no preferred address to compare a link against and the check stays silent on
  it — silence there means "not checked", not "correct". At the time of writing 30 of 40
  pieces are in that state. `unpublished`, `phantom` and `unlinked` are unaffected: they
  only need to know whether an address exists, not what it is.

    here rather than in each of them because each of them answered it by reading
    `public_url`, which is ONE outlet's key (`substack`, Being Good) and not a universal one.

    was added; substack_verify and substack_notes learned it on 2026-09-11 (scriptorium

    corpus gates, the required-outlets rule, the header check and the baseline check alike.

    A `site: true` opt-in is deliberately NOT live here: it records that a piece goes
    somewhere, not an address, and every caller of this wants the address. Hence legacy=None
    by default — pass one only if a bare opt-in should count.

    The piece's own `canonical:` wins when it records one, because that is the piece SAYING
