"""check_verified.py — refuse to compose a piece whose own scaffold says it is not verified.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-02).  *The Knowledge of Good and Evil* went live on 2026-08-25 carrying
about twenty verbatim quotations of a named living person — Corey Taylor, on childhood abuse,
alcoholism, addiction and what he believes about death — pulled from a MACHINE-GENERATED TRANSCRIPT
and never checked against the audio.  The desk knew.  It had written it down three times:

    notes.md:3      "pulled from a machine-generated transcript ... Verify every quote against
                     the actual audio before print (auto-captions garble)"
    log/2026-08.md  "Standing caveat: Corey quotes still from the machine transcript ...
                     the load-bearing quotes want one audio listen."
    README.md:66    a live section still headed "Anchors to verify before print"

and the compose ran anyway, because NOTHING LOOKED THERE.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES, PRECISELY.  The converter already refuses a stray "verify" inside a footnote
and treats a `†` in the body as an unverified claim.  Both of those are BODY-level guards, and the
caveat that mattered was never in the body.  It was in the scaffold — the README, the notes ledger,
the log — which is exactly where an honest writer puts a doubt they have not resolved yet.  A guard
that reads only the artifact and never the notes about the artifact is looking in the one place a
careful person would not have put the warning.

FAIL CLOSED.  A piece with NO verification record at all does not pass.  Silence is not clearance:
the whole failure mode here is a gate that only fires when someone remembered to arm it.

NO --force, ON PURPOSE.  There is deliberately no flag that waves this through.  A flag leaves no
trace in the repo, is typed once under time pressure, and is indistinguishable afterward from a
piece that was actually checked — which is how `--allow-unverified` becomes the normal way to
publish.  (The publish skill already says: never reach for --allow-verify to silence a marker.)
To clear a piece you WRITE THE CLEARANCE DOWN, in publish.yaml, where it is reviewable and
survives:

    verified:
      date: 2026-09-02
      by: Eric
      covers: >-
        All 42 interview quotes checked against the audio; scripture loci and wording against the
        KJV; Goldsmith locus confirmed against the 1947 edition.

That record is the override, and it is an auditable act rather than a keystroke.  `--explain` will
print the block to paste.

WHAT COUNTS AS A BLOCKER.  Phrases that mean "somebody wrote down a doubt and did not resolve it":
UNVERIFIED, "verify ... before print/publishing/going live", "must be checked against", "standing
caveat", "Anchors to verify", "still to do before going live", and a `†` in the draft body.  Where
the phrase sits inside an already-closed statement ("all 12 anchors verified", "zero unverified
markers remain") it is not a blocker — see _CLEARED_CONTEXT.

WHAT THIS TOOL IS NOT.  It does not check whether a citation is CORRECT; it cannot.  It checks
whether anyone has said they checked.  Those are different questions and only the second is
mechanizable.  Do not let a green result here be read as "the sources are good."

RE-SYNC IS NOT COMPOSE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS LOAD-BEARING.  With `--resync` this reports the open
doubts and exits 0.  That is not a softening; it is the gate refusing to do more harm than good.
A fresh compose PUBLISHES CLAIMS, and blocking it is the whole point.  A surgical re-sync of an
already-live post FIXES something on a page the public is already reading, and it introduces no new
claim — the casing sweep of 2026-09-02 is the model.  A gate that also blocks the corrections would
mean the corpus could not be repaired until every ledger in it was closed, and the first person who
hit that would switch the gate off and leave it off.  So: compose blocks, re-sync warns, and the
warning names the doubts that are still open so nobody mistakes a re-sync for a clearance.

Usage:
    check_verified.py pieces/<name> [pieces/<name> ...]   # default: every published piece
    check_verified.py --resync pieces/<name>              # surgical fix to a live post: warn, allow
    check_verified.py --explain pieces/<name>             # print the clearance block to paste
    check_verified.py --list                              # which pieces are cleared, which are not

Exit codes: 0 clear · 1 blocked · 2 usage.
