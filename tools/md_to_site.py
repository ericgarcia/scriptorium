"""md_to_site.py — turn pieces into a content bundle a website can render.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Substack is bespoke because Substack chose to have no write API. Nothing else has
  to be. This emits the neutral artifact described in docs/BUNDLE.md — markdown plus
  front matter plus derived images — so a destination is learned once instead of once
  per site.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
  Leak the desk. `draft.md` is a working file: everything above the first `---` is
  voice notes and verification status, HTML comments are asides, and a `†` inside a
  footnote marks an internal verify note. All three are stripped here, by the same
  rules the Substack converter uses. A draft with no `---` is an ERROR, not a
  best-effort export — guessing at that boundary is how an editorial note reaches a
  reader.

  Publish a piece nobody opted in. A piece must DECLARE its destinations in
  publish.yaml -- `outlets:` naming this outlet, or the legacy `site: true`. A
  directory copy would eventually ship a draft; an allowlist cannot. There is no
  default and no inference: a piece that names no outlet is exported nowhere.

USAGE
  python3 md_to_site.py <bundle-dir> <piece-dir>... [options]

    --canonical-base URL   piece home is <URL>/<slug>; omit for no canonical
    --syndicated OUTLET    record the piece's address ON THAT OUTLET as syndication
                           (e.g. --syndicated substack). The URL is read by the outlet's
                           own `manifest_url_key` (publishing/outlets.yaml), so naming a
                           second Substack records that Substack's URL, not the first's.
    --max-width PX         longest edge of a derived image (default 1600)
    --quality N            WebP quality (default 82)
    --image-store NAME     repo (default) | s3 — recorded in bundle.json
    --outlet NAME          export only pieces whose publish.yaml `outlets:` names NAME
    --tags FILE            force ONE tag vocabulary for every piece. By default each
                           piece's tags are checked against its publication's vocabulary
                           (publications.py), or publishing/tags.yaml on a desk with no
                           publication registry. A piece's `tags:` ship with their labels.
    --include-unpublished  export pieces with no `published_at` (held back by default)
    --force                export even pieces that opted into nothing
    --apply                write. Dry run by default.

EXIT
  0 ok    1 usage    3 nothing opted in    4 a draft is missing its `---`
  5 an image could not be resolved
  8 a piece carries a tag its vocabulary does not define (or there is no vocabulary)
  9 a piece names no publication, or declares an outlet another publication owns
