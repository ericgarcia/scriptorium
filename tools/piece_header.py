"""piece_header.py — make a published piece's draft.md say that it is published.

Every piece keeps its text in `draft.md` for its whole life, which is right: the file is
one thing with one name, and every tool identifies a piece by it. But the scaffold note
at the top went on saying

    *Draft — being-good-essay voice. Full arc §I–§VII...*

on pieces that had been live for weeks. That line is the first thing a human reads when
opening the file, and it says the file is disposable at exactly the moment it has become
the source of record for something people are reading.

So the FILENAME does not change -- renaming would give nine tools a second name to know
about, and any call site that missed it would not error, it would silently drop the piece
from the corpus checks. The HEADER changes instead. It costs nothing: everything above
the first `---` is front matter that the converter discards, so this text can never reach
a reader.

    piece_header.py --check          what is stale (exit 1 if any)
    piece_header.py --apply [slug]   rewrite; idempotent; published pieces only
