"""references.py — bring a source into the desk, index it, and search what is held.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Eric, 2026-09-11: *"make sure that scriptorium is checking references
against resources that we have locally and not from the LLM itself … have a way of
bringing used references into the writing-desk (.gitignoring them if they are
copywritten) and they can be used in the future and are indexed for future reference"*).

  The desk already closed this hole for ONE source. `check_scripture.py` verifies every
  scripture quotation against a local KJV index and knows the house conventions. Nothing
  did it for anything else — and the measurement is blunt: on 2026-09-11 this desk held
  **43 reference files and exactly one index**. `refindex.py --scheme pages` had existed
  for a day and had never been run on anything. So a quotation of Lawrence, McGilchrist,
  Novak or the Ballard opinion was checked by a session opening the PDF and reading it,
  which works when it happens and is silent when it does not.

  The other half is intake. Adding a reference was four hand steps — copy the file, hash
  it, write the manifest row, add the .gitignore line — and built no index. A four-step
  hand procedure is one that gets skipped, and the step most likely to be skipped is the
  .gitignore line on a copyrighted PDF, which is the one that cannot be undone once it is
  in git history.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, SAID FIRST.  Holding a source locally does not make a claim true. This
  makes a quotation CHECKABLE and tells you loudly when one is not; it cannot tell you a
  page says what the prose claims it says. That is `review`'s re-open-the-sources read, and
  it is a human's. (Same warning `check_verified.py` gives about itself, for the same reason.)

THE MANIFEST IS THE README, AND STAYS THE README.  `books/<book>/references/README.md`
  already carries one row per file — work, edition/provenance, date, redistribution — and
  CLAUDE.md names it as the index of what is on disk. A second machine-readable catalog
  beside it would be two sources of truth for one fact, which this desk has already learned
  is worse than one source in the wrong place. So this tool READS and WRITES that table, and
  everything else it needs is derivable: the index is `.index/<stem>.tsv.gz` or it is absent;
  restricted is the ⚠️ in the last column.

USAGE
  references.py add <file> --book <name> --work "<work> — <author> (<year>)"
                 [--edition "<edition / provenance>"] [--restricted | --public]
                 [--scheme auto|pages|text|kjv] [--note "..."] [--no-index]
  references.py list [--book <name>] [--unindexed]
  references.py index <file-or-path> [--scheme ...]        # (re)build one index
  references.py search "<phrase>" [--book <name>] [--source <substr>] [-n <hits>]
  references.py check                                      # manifest ↔ disk ↔ gitignore ↔ index

EXIT
  0  fine
  1  usage / no such thing
