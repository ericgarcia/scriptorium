"""Render a piece as the house REVIEW ARTIFACT — the surface an author reads.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  A rewrite or a critique asks the author to judge *prose*. A draft.md full of
  [^slug] markers, a scaffold header and raw markdown is not the thing they are
  being asked to judge, and chat is not where review facts belong — they scroll
  away.

  Two sessions built this page by hand on 2026-09-09 and 2026-09-10 and produced
  two different formats: different type pairs, different palettes, one with a
  contents list and per-movement word counts and a provenance stamp, the other
  with gate chips and a tighter measure. Both were defensible. That is the
  problem — a format argued fresh each time is a format that drifts, and the
  author has to re-learn the page every time they open one.

  So the format is a TOOL, not a paragraph of instruction. One generator, one
  house page. The prose is parsed out of draft.md and never retyped, for the same
  reason the composer never retypes into Substack: a transcription slip becomes an
  edit nobody can see.

USAGE
  python3 review_artifact.py <piece_dir> [--facts facts.json] [--out page.html]
  python3 review_artifact.py <piece_dir> --apply      # write every `now` into draft.md

  Everything the page shows about the PIECE is read from the piece: title and
  subtitle from publish.yaml, prose and notes from draft.md, the hero from
  assets/, and its COMPANIONS (docs/COMPANIONS.md) after the notes — a Note as it
  will sit in the feed, a talk as its minutes and script. A finding may anchor in
  a Note's text, and --apply writes it into the Note's file. Everything it shows about the REVIEW comes from --facts (see FACTS
  below); with no facts file the page still renders, and the review strip simply
  reports what can be counted.

FACTS (all keys optional)
  version   "v3"                       label in the masthead stamp
  state     ["composed, not published"] flags in the stamp — say the live truth
  date      "10 September 2026"
  voice     "Being Good · argued voice"
  prior     {"words":3072,"movements":8,"notes":11}   deltas are computed
  gates     [["check_links","8 live, 0 dead"], ...]
  calls     [["Short title","One or two sentences of body (HTML ok)."], ...]
  cover     {"caption":"...","provenance":"Generated, not a photograph."}
  findings  [{...}, ...]                a REVIEW's proposed changes — see below

FINDINGS — the review's proposed changes, highlighted where they land
  A finding is anchored to the prose it is about, and the page marks that exact
  span in place and hangs the note under the paragraph it belongs to. The author
  reads the change in its context, which is the only place it can be judged.

    anchor    VERBATIM span of draft.md (markdown and all) that the finding is
              about. Matched against the whitespace-normalised block, so line
              wraps do not matter and `*asterisks*` do. REQUIRED.
    severity  fidelity | argument | voice | open   (colours the mark; default
              `open`). Any other value renders neutral.
    title     the finding in a phrase
    what      the note (HTML ok)
    was/now   the current wording and the proposal, rendered verbatim in mono as
              a two-row diff — so a change of punctuation or case is legible
    evidence  what the claim was checked against (HTML ok)

  Findings are numbered in the order given — rank them; that ranking is what the
  author reads first.

  **The anchor is not allowed to miss.** An anchor that matches nothing, matches
  more than one place, or overlaps another finding's anchor EXITS 3 and names it.
  A finding that silently fails to highlight leaves a page that looks complete and
  is not, which is the one failure a review page must never have. Lengthen the
  anchor until it is unique.
