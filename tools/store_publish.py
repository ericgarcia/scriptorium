store_publish.py — upload a published bundle to the content store.

The store is what a site reads. Putting a bundle in it is the whole of "publishing" for
a web outlet: no build, no deploy, no site repo touched. A correction is live in about a
minute, which is the property the whole design is for.

  usage: python3 tools/store_publish.py <bundle-dir>
                 [--config publishing/store.yaml] [--dry-run] [--prune]

The bundle directory is laid out the way BUNDLE.md says, and this tool does not care
what is in it beyond choosing a Cache-Control per prefix:

  <bundle>/index.json
  <bundle>/pieces/<slug>.json
  <bundle>/talks/<slug>/…
  <bundle>/images/<slug>/…

Three properties worth stating, because each is a decision:

  IDEMPOTENT   An object whose bytes and Cache-Control already match is skipped, so
               re-publishing an unchanged bundle uploads nothing and invalidates
               nothing. That is what makes "publish everything" a safe default.

  ADDITIVE     Remote objects missing from the bundle are left alone unless --prune is
               given. A partial bundle should not silently unpublish a corpus.

  FIRE AND     An invalidation is created and not waited on. The publishing role can
  FORGET       create invalidations but cannot read them back, so a wait step fails with
               AccessDenied and looks like a broken publish. Confirm by re-fetching.

Then, for every site under `revalidate:` in the config, the publish is made visible at once
rather than within a minute (quire 0.17, `quire/next`):

  REVALIDATE   Wait until the CDN serves the uploaded bytes of every JSON key that changed —
               re-fetching, since the invalidation cannot be read back — then POST those keys
               to the site, which expires exactly their cache tags. Order matters: a site
               told to refetch while the edge still holds the old copy re-caches the old text
               for another window, so a key the CDN has not yet turned over is never pinged.
               The secret comes from the macOS Keychain (`secret_keychain`), never the config.

    revalidate:
      - site: alignmentfellowship
        url: https://alignmentfellowship.org/api/revalidate/
        secret_keychain: quire-revalidate-alignmentfellowship

Exit 0 published (and revalidated, where configured); 1 usage or config; 4 and 7 refusals
(see below); 5 uploaded, but a site could not be confirmed revalidated — it catches up by
itself within its revalidate window, so this is a delay, not a lost publish.
