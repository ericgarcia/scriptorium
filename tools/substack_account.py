"""substack_account.py — which browser a Substack operation runs in, and is it the right person?

WHY (2026-09-11).  A desk can own several Substack outlets on different accounts — one per
byline, because a Substack profile has one display name across every publication under it. A
Substack login is ONE cookie for every `*.substack.com` publication, and the built-in browser
pane's cookie store is shared by every tab and every session: a cookie set in one pane tab was
present in a fresh one, and a session that had never signed in found the pane signed in as the
other session's account. So the pane can hold one Substack account, never two — and signing it
out, or into another account, silently turns every concurrent session's work into the other
byline's: a compose lands in the wrong publication, a re-sync edits a post its session does not
own, and nothing errors.

THE RULE (Eric, 2026-09-11).  With more than one Substack outlet, ONE is the PRIMARY. The primary
uses the built-in browser pane for all its Substack operations; every other Substack outlet opens
in Claude in Chrome, each in its own named browser holding its own login. Naming the primary
explicitly beats inferring it from whatever the pane happens to be signed in as. Changing it is a
deliberate, desk-wide act (`primary <outlet>`), because it changes whose login the pane must hold.

Every write still proves it is on the right account first (`check`), so a session caught
mid-switch is refused rather than published under the wrong byline.

CONFIG (instance-side, publishing/outlets.yaml; the framework holds no handles)

    substack_primary: substack            # top level — names exactly one Substack outlet
    outlets:
      substack:
        reader_base: https://elmuffin.substack.com/p/
        account_handle: elmuffin          # the profile handle that must be signed in to write
        chrome_browser: <name>            # only needed if it is ever demoted
      substack-muffinlabs:
        reader_base: https://muffinlabs.substack.com/p/
        account_handle: ericgarciaphd
        chrome_browser: eric@muffinlabs.ai   # REQUIRED for a non-primary: it opens in Chrome

  A Substack outlet is one whose `reader_base` is on `*.substack.com`, or that says
  `platform: substack` (a custom domain). With only one Substack outlet it is the primary without
  saying so. `account_handle` is REQUIRED to write: `notes_handle` names the same person today,
  but it is a Notes-feed display setting, never a write permission.

USAGE
    substack_account.py route <outlet>          # its surface (pane | chrome + browser), account, snippet
    substack_account.py primary                 # the primary, and where every Substack outlet runs
    substack_account.py primary <outlet>        # make <outlet> the primary (edits outlets.yaml)
    substack_account.py check <outlet> --surface pane|chrome --result '<the snippet's JSON>'
    substack_account.py snippet

  Run the snippet on any `*.substack.com` page of that surface — the publication's own host, where
  the editor lives, is fine. It must be SAME-ORIGIN: a fetch from a publication host to
  substack.com fails in the pane (measured), so the snippet uses a relative path.

  `check` takes the snippet's answer VERBATIM, never a handle typed in: a typed handle can pass
  without the snippet ever running. The answer carries its origin and HTTP status, so `check` also
  refuses one read on a page that is neither the outlet's own nor Substack's, and treats only a
  401/403 as signed out — a 404 or 5xx says nothing about who is signed in.

  THE GUARD IN EVERY SNIPPET.  `check` confirms the account ONCE. But the pane's cookie store is
  shared by every tab and every session, so another session can switch the pane's login between
  that check and the write — and the write lands under the wrong byline, with no error. So every
  generated script that reads or writes a Substack editor or its API opens with `guard_js`: the
  same same-origin profile fetch as the snippet, run IN THE SAME EVAL as the work, which returns
  `{"refused": …, "accountGuard": true, …}` before the document is touched unless the page is the
  outlet's own publication AND is signed in as its `account_handle`. The PUBLICATION half matters
  because one account can own several publications: the handle would match and the post would be
  the wrong one. `guard_for_piece` settles which Substack outlet a piece writes to (its publish.yaml
  `outlets:`, via outlets.yaml); a generator that cannot settle it writes nothing (exit 9). `wrap`
  makes a snippet one promise-valued expression, so the javascript_tool REPL, a `<script>` that
  assigns it to a global, and a test harness's `await eval(...)` all get its return value.

    substack_account.py guard <piece-dir>        # the outlet and account a piece's snippets insist on

  FINDING THE CHROME BROWSER.  `chrome_browser` is the name the browser was given at Claude in
  Chrome's Connect prompt — until someone names it, list_connected_browsers shows "Browser 1/2/3".
  So: list_connected_browsers; select_browser the one named EXACTLY as outlets.yaml says; if it is
  not there, switch_browser and give it exactly that name. Never pick one by guessing from the
  list, and ask the author before driving a browser.

EXIT
  0  ok — signed in as the outlet's account, on the outlet's surface (or: primary changed)
  1  usage, or no such outlet
  3  signed out — the author signs in (automation never enters credentials)
  4  checked on the wrong surface — this outlet runs in the other browser
  5  signed in as SOMEONE ELSE — stop; do not write here, and do not switch this surface
  6  misconfigured — no account_handle, several Substack outlets and no primary, a non-primary
     with no chrome_browser, or a demotion that would leave an outlet nowhere to run
  7  the answer settles nothing — not the snippet's JSON, read on a page that is neither the
     outlet's nor Substack's, or an HTTP status other than 401/403. Run the snippet again on the
     right page; do NOT send the author off to sign in
  9  (guard, and every snippet generator) the piece's Substack account cannot be settled — no
     outlets.yaml, no Substack outlet in its `outlets:`, two of them, or no account_handle
