test_suite.py — the desk's regression suite.  Run:  python3 framework/tools/test_suite.py

SAFETY, because this suite exists partly to replace a shell loop that was not safe:

  * It DELETES NOTHING.  Every generated file goes inside one `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`,
    which the interpreter removes on exit.  There is no `rm` anywhere, and no path is ever
    interpolated into a shell command.
  * It makes NO NETWORK CALLS and drives NO BROWSER, so it can never touch a live post.
    Everything about "live" behaviour is exercised against a stubbed ProseMirror document.
  * It only READS the repository.  Nothing under `pieces/` or `framework/` is written.

The earlier version of this was a bash loop containing `rm -f $S/*` with `$S` unquoted — one
empty variable away from `rm -f /*`.  That is the reason the runner is a program now: a suite
that guards a publishing pipeline should not itself be the most dangerous thing in the repo.

WHAT IT COVERS — every case here is a bug that actually happened (2026-09-01):

  unit    quote/whitespace normalization, and the length-preservation split between the
          positional domain (`flatten_quotes`) and the equality domain (`H`)
  unit    three-way classification: push / pull / converged / conflict / unchanged
  unit    footnote ordering is REFERENCE order, not label order
  unit    escaped asterisks, bullet lists, adjacent-blockquote merging
  unit    footnote blocks render through the footnote path, not the paragraph path
  unit    the CDN image wrapper unwraps to the asset it points at
  unit    a pulled edit is verified by re-rendering; the one confirmed refusal (a
          whitespace run, which no markdown source can produce) is asserted, and no
          other refusal is asserted speculatively
  corpus  every piece renders; no undefined / duplicated / nested footnote refs; no
          unverified † notes left in any draft
  unit    the reader-side extractor, against canned markup (still no network)
  corpus  every live piece's header says it is live, not a draft
  corpus  every published piece matches its sealed baseline
  engine  the JS patcher's own suite (A–E) against every piece, via a stubbed editor
  unit    the pronoun sweep's sections E and F look INSIDE a scripture quotation — the four
          casing/bracket misses measured in *False Light* on 2026-09-07 are reproduced as a
          fixture and must all be listed; --strict warns on them and does not refuse
  unit    tags: the textual `tags:` writer keeps every comment and refuses any write that
          would change another key; an undefined tag stops at the exporter
  corpus  every tag a piece carries is in the desk's vocabulary
  unit    publications: the registry, a piece's one publication, a vocabulary per publication,
          and the store refusing one publication's piece over another's slug
  corpus  with a registry, every manifest names its publication and owns its outlets

And the answer: *Get thee hence.*[^matt4] Not riches in the abstract. And the reason He gives is
worth the whole essay: *Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.* The
question on the mountain was never competence.

*For He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
the unjust.*[^matt545] The rain is not a reward.

Set that next to the man who said this instead. *I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I
judge … because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.*[^john530]
*Without me ye can do nothing.*[^john155] The grammar of the two texts runs in opposite directions.

He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father: *He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.*[^john149]
Paul says it plainly: *I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.*[^phil413] John
the elder says *We love [Them], because [They] first loved us.*[^1john] The point is *not* that
*He* wins; the point is that the exam was refused.

> And He said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?[^mark440]

Read it as a plural of majesty if you like, or as God in deliberation — the *form* is still
plural, in the mouth of God, in the first chapter. And the likeness that comes out the far side of
that sentence is, we've already seen, itself two: male and female. A plural form, speaking of
itself in the plural, and making an image that isn't one thing either.

God is not male. They are the One Xenophanes' oxen could not draw, the no-form seen at Horeb, the
verb that refused to harden into a noun, the source that called itself *us* before They had made
anything at all.

God knows themself the way no creature is known. The Father itself is a phrase this house would
never write. They are doing the thing itself, and *I am that I am, saith the LORD unto itself*[^ex]
is the source's wording, not ours.

Press *all-powerful* hard enough and it leaves no room for a second thing standing outside God on
its own ground. That the clutching self is the source of its own suffering is not a finding a
follower of Jesus has to hold at arm's length.

If God's power is total there is no second engine running anywhere on its own. And the corrected
line reads: the source that called Themself *us*, a plural form speaking of Themself in the plural.
