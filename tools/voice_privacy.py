voice_privacy.py — an instance's voices never reach the framework.

A voice (`styles/<name>/` in the instance) is the most personal thing a desk holds: the author's
rules, their corrections, the texts they tune against. The framework is public. The split has
always been the promise (README: "your personal trained voices live only in your instance"); this
is the check that keeps it, because a framework edited daily by sessions that have just read a
private constitution will, eventually, paste a line of one into a doc.

Names are not what leaks — a framework doc may say `being-good-essay` as an example of a family
name. CONTENT leaks. So the check is textual:

  1. No `framework/styles/<name>` shares a name with an instance voice. A private voice copied
     into the framework is the whole leak at once.
  2. No run of RUN consecutive words (default 12) from an instance voice's files — style.md,
     config.yaml, corrections.md, exemplars/ — appears in any framework text file.

  What is NOT the author's, and so does not count:
    - runs from `framework/templates/style/`, with `<name>` read as the voice's own name (the
      scaffold every voice is seeded from);
    - runs from the starter a voice declares it was seeded from — `seeded_from: plain-english`
      in its config.yaml. Declared, never inferred: the same run in a starter and a private
      voice is either inheritance or a leak, and only the author knows which.

THE BASELINE — a ratchet, so the check is useful the day it lands

  The first run on this desk (2026-09-11) found framework text that already overlapped private
  voices: house rules generalized into tools, scripture both quote. Those are a cleanup, not a
  reason to ship a check that is red forever. `--accept` records every current hit in
  `<instance>/styles/.privacy-baseline.json` — as SHA-1s of the runs, never the runs, so the
  baseline leaks nothing even if it were published — and later runs fail only on hits not in it.
  The file lives with the voices, which is to say in the private repo. `--accept` is the one
  writing operation here and is never run by the suite.

Usage:  voice_privacy.py [--instance <root>] [--run 12] [--accept] [--all]
          --all   report baselined hits too
Exit:   0 clean, 1 a new leak found, 2 no instance to compare (framework alone: nothing to do)
